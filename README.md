# house-price-predictor
A machine learning web application to predict house prices based on the California Housing Dataset using Linear Regression and Random Forest models. Developed in Google Colab with data preprocessing, model training, and an interactive Gradio GUI for predictions and exploratory data analysis.

#Project Highlights
Predict median house prices in California
Two models compared for performance:
Linear Regression – R² Score: 0.58
Random Forest Regressor – R² Score: 0.81
Interactive data visualizations (EDA, residual plots)
Clean and intuitive Gradio GUI
Model trained and saved using joblib

#Features
Real-time prediction using input values (e.g., Median Income, House Age, etc.)
Visual insights into data via:
Distribution plots
Correlation heatmap
Actual vs. Predicted prices
Residual (error) distribution

#Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
Gradio (for GUI)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
Google Colab (for development)
ChatGPT (for idea assistance)
